# TF Easy Colors Map (Krita plugin)

#### WHAT IS
TF Easy Colors Map is a plugin for Krita for creating a Map (a collection) of your favourite colors in a very simple way. The final result of your Map can be something like this:

#### HOW IT WORKS
All starts creating a new Colors Map, which is a simple .txt file. Now, you can start adding your colors and, if you want, organizing them with titles.
Adding a colors is pretty simple: once you have the desired color set in the Krita document **foreground**, just **right** click your Map, type a name when requested and it's added to your collection.

If you need to catch more colors (for example, grabbing them from an image) you can automize the process. Just press the "Auto Add Colors" button and start using the Krita's Color Sampler tool to select your desired color. Every time the foreground color changes, the Colors Map will ask you to type a name and that color is added into your Map. When you finished, press the "Auto Add Colors" button again to stop this feature.
